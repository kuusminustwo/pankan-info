# PRIVACY POLICY FOR PANKAN

**Last Updated: [Current Date, e.g., May 18, 2025]**

Hi there! This is the Privacy Policy for PanKan, our Japanese learning app for Mongolian speakers, created by Khuslen Ganbold ("we," "us," or "our"). We want to be clear about how we handle your information.

By using PanKan, you agree to this policy. If you have questions, email us at huslenganbold42@gmail.com.

## What Information We Collect

To make PanKan work and help you learn, we collect some information:

1.  **Information You Give Us:**
    *   **Account Details:** Your name and email address when you sign up (or if you use Google Sign-In, we get this from Google). This helps us create and manage your account.
    *   **Payment Info (for Subscriptions):** If you subscribe, payment is handled by Apple (App Store) or RevenueCat. We don't store your full credit card details. They have their own privacy policies.

2.  **Information We Collect Automatically:**
    *   **Learning Progress:** How you use the app, like lessons completed, quiz scores, and your Spaced Repetition System (SRS) data. This is essential for the app to track your learning.
    *   **Device & Usage Info:** Basic info about your device (like model and operating system) and how you interact with app features. This helps us improve the app and fix bugs.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

*   Run and improve PanKan (make it work, add features, fix problems).
*   Manage your account and learning progress.
*   Personalize your learning experience (especially with SRS).
*   Process your subscription payments (through Apple/RevenueCat).
*   Communicate with you (like for support or important updates).
*   Understand how our app is used so we can make it better.

## How We Share Your Information

**We do not sell your personal information.** We only share it in specific situations:

*   **Service Providers:** We use some third-party services to help us run PanKan. Examples:
    *   **Google:** For user sign-in (Google Sign-In) and cloud services to store your data and run app functions (like Google Cloud Platform, Firebase).
    *   **Apple & RevenueCat:** To process subscription payments.
    *   **TestFlight (Apple):** If you're helping us test a beta version.
    These providers are only allowed to use your information to help us, not for their own purposes.
*   **Legal Reasons:** If we're required by law (like a court order) or to protect our rights or the safety of others.
*   **Business Changes:** If we sell or merge PanKan, your information might be transferred to the new owner. We'd let you know.

## Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information. However, no online service is 100% secure, so we can't guarantee absolute security.

## Data Retention

We keep your information as long as you have an account with us or as long as needed to provide the PanKan service. We also keep it if the law requires us to.

## Children's Privacy

PanKan is not for children under 18. We don't knowingly collect information from them. If you believe a child has given us information, please contact us.

## Your Choices & Rights

*   **Account Info:** You can usually review and update your account information within the app or by contacting us.
*   **Delete Account:** You can request to delete your account by contacting us. We'll delete your data, though we might keep some for legal reasons or to prevent fraud.
*   **Push Notifications:** You can turn these off in your device settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We might update this policy. If we do, we'll post the new version in the app and change the "Last Updated" date. For big changes, we might also email you or show a notice in the app.
