# TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR PANKAN

**Last Updated: [Current Date - e.g., May 19, 2025]**

## 1. Welcome to PanKan!

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you ("you" or "User") and Khuslen Ganbold, operating as PanKan ("PanKan," "we," "us," or "our"). These Terms govern your use of the PanKan mobile application (the "App") and any related services we offer (collectively, the "Services").

Our contact email is huslenganbold42@gmail.com. Our registered address is Khan-uul duureg, Artsatiin am, GardenCity, 1305-303, Ulaanbaatar, Ulaanbaatar 17100, Mongolia.

**By using PanKan, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the App.**

**Changes to Terms:** We may update these Terms. If we do, we'll notify you within the App and change the "Last Updated" date above. Using PanKan after an update means you accept the new Terms.

**Who Can Use PanKan:** You must be at least 13 years old. If you're between 13 and 18 (or your local age of majority), your parent or guardian must agree to these Terms for you.

## 2. Using PanKan

**License to Use:** As long as you follow these Terms, we give you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the PanKan App for your personal, non-commercial learning.

**Our Intellectual Property:** PanKan, its content (lessons, designs, code, etc.), and our logos/trademarks ("Content and Marks") are owned by us or licensed to us and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, distribute, sell, or use our Content and Marks for commercial purposes without our written permission.

**Your Feedback:** If you send us feedback or suggestions ("Submissions"), they become our property. We can use them without compensating you or giving you credit. You promise your Submissions are original to you (or you have the right to share them) and don't violate any laws or third-party rights.

**Location & Local Laws:** If you use PanKan outside Mongolia, you are responsible for complying with your local laws.

## 3. Your Account

To use PanKan, you'll sign in, for example, via your Apple or Google account. You're responsible for all activity on your PanKan account and for keeping your Apple/Google account secure.

You promise that any information you provide (even indirectly through Apple/Google sign-in) is accurate and that you'll keep it current.

## 4. Subscriptions (Paid Services)

Some PanKan features may require a paid subscription ("Subscription").

*   **Automatic Renewal:** Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel them. Apple will charge your payment method for each renewal period.
*   **Cancellation:** **You must cancel your Subscription through your Apple ID account settings on your device.** Deleting the app won't cancel it. If you cancel, your access continues until the end of your current paid period. We can't cancel it for you, but we can guide you if you email us.
*   **Refunds:** **For refunds, you must contact Apple Support.** We don't issue refunds directly for App Store purchases.

## 9. Term and Termination

These Terms remain in effect while you use PanKan.

We can suspend or terminate your account and access to PanKan at any time, for any reason, without notice, including if we believe you have violated these Terms or any applicable law. You can also stop using PanKan and request account deletion by contacting us (though subscription cancellation must be done via Apple).

If your account is terminated, you are prohibited from creating a new account without our permission. Some sections of these Terms will still apply even after termination (like Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, and Dispute Resolution).

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranties (What We Don't Promise)

**PanKan is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind (express or implied).**
This means we don't promise that PanKan will:
*   Always work perfectly, be uninterrupted, or be error-free.
*   Meet all your specific requirements or learning goals.
*   Be completely secure or free of viruses or harmful components.
*   Provide information that is always accurate or reliable.
Any defects or errors may not always be corrected. You use PanKan at your own risk.

**Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to the lesser of:**
*   **the amount paid, if any, by you to us for the Services during the six (6) month period prior to any cause of action arising, OR**
*   **thirty U.S. dollars ($30.00 USD).**

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of these limitations may not apply to you.

## 12. Indemnification (Your Responsibility for Harm)

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless (including our employees and agents) from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) your use of the Services; (2) your breach of these Terms; (3) any breach of your promises (representations and warranties) in these Terms; (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including intellectual property rights; or (5) any harmful act toward any other user of the Services with whom you connected via the Services.

We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.

## 13. Dispute Resolution

**Informal Negotiations:** To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each a "Dispute"), you and PanKan agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one party to the other. You will send your notice to huslenganbold42@gmail.com.

**Binding Arbitration:** If we cannot resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the rules of an arbitration body agreed upon by the parties, or if no agreement, then under the rules of a recognized international arbitration body chosen by us, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**Restrictions:** You and PanKan agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between PanKan and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

*   **Entire Agreement:** These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us.
*   **No Waiver:** Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
